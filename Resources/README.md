If the CSV file, AllOilCompanies.csv, does not exist, the Jupyter Notebook, PyOilSectorAnalysis.ipynb, generates it by sorting through the entire Yahoo Finance database, which takes approximately an hour to complete.  For future runs, the Jupyter Notebook instead reads AllOilCompanies.csv file to save a significant amount of time.
